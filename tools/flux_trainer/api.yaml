name: Flux LoRA trainer
description: Finetune a model on top of Flux-dev
tip: This will create a LoRA model from a base Flux-dev which captures and integrates the style, human face, or object represented in the training data.

  type: image[]
  required: true
  min_length: 1
- name: caption_prefix
  label: Trigger word
  description: Trigger word for training. Ideally a single word that represents your concept in prompts!
  type: string
  required: true
  default: TOK
- name: max_train_steps
  label: Training steps
  description: Number of training steps. Only increase this if you have lots of images (>50) otherwise the model wil overfit and will not look good.
  type: int
  default: 2000
  minimum: 500
  maximum: 4000
  step: 50
- name: lora_rank
  label: Rank
  description: LoRA rank. Higher gives model more capacity to learn but often lead to overfitting.
  type: int
  default: 8
  minimum: 4
  maximum: 24
  step: 1
- name: learning_rate
  label: Learning rate
  description: Learning rate for training. Higher values converge faster but too high might cause overfitting. Low values are more accurate but slower.

  minimum: 0.0001
  maximum: 0.0010

  label: Learning rate decay
  description: Learning rate decay for training. Higher values decay faster but too high might cause overfitting. Low values are more accurate but slower.

- name: seed
  label: Seed
  description: Set random seed for reproducibility. If blank, will be set to a random value.
  tip: You should only set this if you want to start from/copy the seed of a previous image. Unless one is specified, you should leave this blank!
