Create a list of storyboard frames corresponding to the scenes in the same order. There should usually be 1 frame per scene, but you can have 2 frames for a scene if the action is complex.

Each frame contains the following things:
- An image prompt, which simply describes what is happening in the frame, referencing the characters (if any) and action. Do not include dialogue, aesthetic details, or adjectives. This should be very plain and literal.
- Dialogue for the frame, which is a series of lines spoken by characters, or by a narrator if there is one. There should usually be 1-4 lines of dialogue per frame. Aim for around 100 words per frame. If there's only one line of dialogue, make sure it's long -- at least 60 words.

The image prompt and dialogue should be treated independently, as they are going to different people to follow up.

Lastly, in addition to the frame list, write a prompt for a single musical composition that will serve as the background soundtrack for the entire film. The prompt should be densely packed with details about the music, including instruments, mood, tempo, and any other details that a composer would need to know."""
